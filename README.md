# Throne

A slideshow program written in Java, **Throne** is the answer (still in its early stages) to my distaste for the default photo viewers I have used in the past.
In particular, I had problems with the Windows 10 default photo viewers.

When using multiple displays, if one uses the Windows Photos slideshow, you can select which monitor to fullscreen 
and run the slideshow; however, options like shuffle or duration of an image are not available. One could use the 
Windows Explorer slideshow, which has those settings, but it only displays images to the main monitor.
